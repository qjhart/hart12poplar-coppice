$rootP$ & These parameters specify root allocation to growth after coppicing. &\\
frac & [$\reciprocal\unit{30.4}{\day}$] & The fractional amount of root biomass that exceeds the aboveground requirements that can be supplied in a given month. & 1\\
LAITarget [\square\meter\per\square\meter] & A target LAI rate.  The Target LAI is included in the calculation of a target NPP, based on weather paramaters.  Below this target, the roots will contribute biomass if the below ground root mass exceeds the requirements of the aboveground biomass. The target is specified in LAI to time root contributions to periods of growth & 10\\
efficiency & [\kilogram\per\kilogram] & Specifies the efficiency in converting root biomass into aboveground biomass. & 0.75\\
