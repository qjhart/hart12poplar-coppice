abstract = {Short rotation coppice culture systems are characterized by a high stool and shoot density, and by rotation durations between 2 and 3 years for species showing an extremely fast growth such as poplar. With the objective to study the long-term biomass production evolution and dynamic of such systems, a high-density plantation with 17 poplar (Populus) clones belonging to six parentages was established in April 1996 and coppiced in December 1996, January 2001, and February 2004. At the end of each growing season, stool survival, shoot diameter, and the number of shoots per stool were measured. Biomass production was estimated directly by harvesting a number of shoots or indirectly via allometric power equations. Stool survival rates differed among parentages and from year to year irrespective of number of rotations; the highest rates were for P. nigra and the lowest rates were for P. deltoides × P. nigra and P. deltoides × P. trichocarpa parentages. In the second and third rotations, the P. trichocarpa × P. deltoides hybrids showed very high mortality rates. The number of shoots per stool varied among rotations and parentages, and shoot elimination was parentage specific. The number of shoots per stool increased with increasing rotation number, while they decreased from year to year within each rotation. A single general allometric equation linking shoot diameter to shoot biomass could be used to estimate biomass production for most years and most clones. Exceptions were found for the year 2001 and for clone Hazendans. Biomass production differed among parentages and among rotations. The different parentages also differed in their strategy of biomass accumulation. Although P. nigra had the highest biomass production over 11 years, the parentage ranking of biomass production shifted over rotations. The P. trichocarpa × P. deltoides hybrids showed high biomass production in the first rotation, but low in the second and third rotations. Biomass production increased from year to year within one rotation, while it decreased with rotation number. Among the parentages examined, P. nigra and P. trichocarpa were the best performing ones and the best adapted to the multiple coppice rotations.},

abstract = {Establishing short-rotation tree plantations for bioenergy and fiber production on agricultural land (abandoned farmland) would provide significant environmental and economic benefits for rural communities and society as a whole. Walker hybrid poplar (Populus deltoides x P. nigra) is one of the most commonly used varieties cultivated in Saskatchewan, Canada; however, there are no existing hybrid poplar growth models in the literature. The aim of this work was to parameterize and evaluate the 3PG model (Physiological Principles in Predicting Growth) to predict Walker tree growth in the climate and soils of Saskatchewan. We used annual data from Walker poplar trials (4- to 11-yr old stands) established at three spacing levels (2.4, 3.0, and 3.7 m) at three sites located in central Saskatchewan, Hnr, BH, and ML sites. The data were split into two sets – the modeling set from the Hnr site was used to parameterize 3PG, and the testing sets from the BH and ML sites were used to evaluate Walker growth predictions made by 3PG. The bias, sum(predicted minus observed) divided by number of observations, for tree height predictions ranged from −1.76 to 1.45 m, and bias for diameter at breast height (DBH) ranged from −2.61 to 0.66 cm. Regression R-square values of 3PG-predicted versus observed height and DBH ranged from 0.75 to 0.98. Our results indicated that, once parameterized, 3PG could predict Walker hybrid poplar growth with desirable accuracy by only utilizing commonly available soils and climate data for marginal or more productive agricultural land across Saskatchewan.},

abstract = {Different allometric relationships were established at the leaf, branch, stem and whole-tree levels for young poplar (Populus) trees during their first and second year of growth. Five poplar clones were grown under an intensively cultured regime at two different locations, Afsnee (near Gent, Belgium) and Orsay (near Paris, France). Leaf area was related linearly or non-linearly (power or logarithmic functions) to parameters that can be measured easily and non-destructively, such as leaf length or width, stem or branch diameter, stem or tree height, and volume index. Only small differences in the basic allometric relationships were noticed between the two sites and the five clones. A very good agreement was observed between leaf area index (LAI) values estimated from allometric relations and from indirect measurements using a plant canopy analyzer. These observations suggest that simple and general relations can be used to estimate LAI in young, high density poplar stands or leaf area at different organizational levels in trees.},

Production of bioenergy is expected to increase. As a result, we foresee an increase in the number of biorefineries in the near future. This paper analyzes logistical challenges with supplying biomass to a biorefinery. We also propose a mathematical model that can be used to design the supply chain and manage the logistics of a biorefinery. Supply chain-design decisions are long-term type of decisions; while logistics management involves medium to short-term decisions. The proposed model coordinates these decisions. The model determines the number, size and location of biorefineries needed to produce biofuel using the available biomass. The model also determines the amount of biomass shipped, processed and inventoried during a time period. Inputs to the model are the availability of biomass feedstock, as well as biomass transportation, inventory and processing costs. We use the State of Mississippi as the testing ground of this model.},

abstract = {The control of the quality of irradiation data is often a prerequisite to their further processing. Though data are usually controlled by meteorological offices, the sources are so numerous that the user often faces time-series of measurements containing questionable values. As customers of irradiation data, we established our own procedures to screen time-series of measurements. Since this problem of quality control is of concern to many researchers and engineers and since it is often a lengthy and tedious task, we decided to make this screening procedure available to everyone as a web service. This service is the purpose of this paper. The objective is not to perform a precise and fine control, an objective out of reach without details on the site and instruments, but to perform a likelihood control of the data and to check their plausibility. This is achieved by comparing observations with some expectations based upon the extraterrestrial irradiation and a simulation of the irradiation for clear skies. This service is available to everyone on the Web site www.helioclim.net. It offers a very convenient means to check time-series of irradiation: Data are input in a HTML page by a copy and paste procedure and the return is also a HTML page that can be analyzed in detail for the data flagged as suspicious. © Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {To determine the effects of shade on biomass, carbon allocation patterns and photosynthetic response, seedlings of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.), white pine (Pinus strobus L.), red maple (Acer rubrum L.), and yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.) were grown without shade or in shade treatments providing a 79 or 89\% reduction of full sunlight for two growing seasons. The shade treatments resulted in less total biomass for all species, with loblolly pine showing the greatest shade-induced growth reduction. Yellow-poplar was the only species to show increased stem height growth in the 89\% shade treatment. The shade treatments increased specific leaf area of all species. Quantum efficiency, dark respiration and light compensation point were generally not affected by the shade treatments. Quantum efficiency, dark respiration, maximum photosynthesis and light compensation point did not change consistently between the first and second growing seasons. We conclude that differences in shade tolerance among these species are not the result of changes in the photosynthetic mechanism in response to shade.},

In this study, Earth observation satellite data were used to map global forest loss (2.3 million square kilometers) and gain (0.8 million square kilometers) from 2000 to 2012 at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil's well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms.

abstract = {We studied water flux in a four-year-old stand of hybrid Populus during midsummer 1992. Study trees ranged in height from 11.0 to 15.1 m and in diameter from 8.3 to 15.1 cm. The large-leafed Populus hybrid was relatively poorly coupled to the atmosphere. The average value of the stomatal decoupling coefficient, \{Omega\}, was 0.66, indicating that, on average, a 10\% change in stomatal conductance would result in only a 3 to 4\% change in transpiration. During the middle of the summer, the smallest study tree used between 20 and 26 kg of water per day, whereas the largest tree used between 39 and 51 kg day-1. The maximum observed rate of stand water loss was 4.8 mm day-1 in this Populus clone. Maximum rates of sap velocity within the xylem were as high as 12.5 m h-1; measured rates for exposed sunlit branches approached 90\% of this maximum. Within-canopy patterns of stomatal conductance generally reflected patterns of incident radiation. Stomatal conductance of foliage grown in shade, even when exposed to non-limiting light and water source conditions, did not increase appreciably. Patterns of stomatal conductance under limiting and non-limiting conditions suggested that both stomatal conductance and leaf specific hydraulic conductivity (LSHC) were linked with the ability to exploit the light resource.},

abstract = {We examined the tradeoffs between stand-level water use and carbon uptake that result when biomass production of trees in plantations is maximized by removing nutrient and water limitations. A Populus trichocarpa Torr. x P. deltoides Bartr. \& Marsh. plantation was irrigated and received frequent additions of nutrients to optimize biomass production. Sap flux density was measured continuously over four of the six growing-season months, supplemented with periodic measurements of leaf gas exchange and water potential. Measurements of tree diameter and height were used to estimate leaf area and biomass production based on allometric relationships. Sap flux was converted to canopy conductance and analyzed with an empirical model to isolate the effects of water limitation. Actual and soil-water-unlimited potential CO(2) uptakes were estimated with a canopy conductance constrained carbon assimilation (4C-A) scheme, which couples actual or potential canopy conductance with vertical gradients of light distribution, leaf-level conductance, maximum Rubisco capacity and maximum electron transport. Net primary production (NPP) was about 43\% of gross primary production (GPP); when estimated for individual trees, this ratio was independent of tree size. Based on the NPP/GPP ratio, we found that current irrigation reduced growth by about 18\% compared with growth with no water limitation. To achieve maximum growth, however, would require 70\% more water for transpiration, and would reduce water-use efficiency by 27\%, from 1.57 to 1.15 g stem wood C kg(-1) water. Given the economic and social values of water, plantation managers appear to have optimized water use.},

@article{Landsberg1997,
abstract = {This paper describes a stand growth model, based on physiological processes, which incorporates a number of steps and procedures that have allowed considerable simplification relative to extant process-based models. The model, called 3-PG (use of Physiological Principles in Predicting Growth), calculates total carbon fixed (gross primary production; PG) from utilizable, absorbed photosynthetically active radiation ($\phi$p.a.u.), obtained by correcting the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the forest canopy ($\phi$p.a.) for the effects of soil drought, atmospheric vapour pressure deficits and stand age. PG is obtained from $\phi$p.a.u. and the canopy quantum efficiency, values of which are becoming available. The ratio of net (PN) to gross primary production is emerging as relatively constant for trees. This eliminates the need to calculate respiration and is used to estimate PN—the net amount of carbon converted to biomass. 3-PG uses a simple relationship to estimate the amount of carbon allocated below ground and a procedure based on allometric ratios—widely available for many species and situations—to determine the allocation of carbon to foliage and stems and constrain tree growth patterns. The effects of nutrition are incorporated through the carbon allocation procedure; the amount of carbon allocated below ground will increase with decreasing soil fertility. Recently acquired knowledge about the physiological factors causing decline in forest growth rates with age is used to model that decline. Changes in stem populations (self-thinning) are derived from a procedure based on the −32 power law, combined with stem growth rates. The model requires weather data as input, works on monthly time steps and has been run for periods up to 120 years, producing realistic patterns of stem growth and stem diameter increments. The time course of leaf area index is realistic for a range of soil conditions and atmospheric constraints. 3-PG can be run from remotely-sensed estimates of leaf area index coupled to weather data and basic, readily available information about soils and stand characteristics. It is being tested as a practical tool against forestry data from New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria and New Zealand. Test results show excellent correspondence between stand growth measurements and simulated stem growth over 30 years.},

Despite interest in this approach, little attention has been paid to the best metrics for assessing the growth performance of grafted plants over time. Based on an analysis of the grafting literature and our own data, we show that the choice of metrics to assess tree growth can entirely change the conclusions reached about the relative importance of age versus size. We recommend that absolute as well as relative rates of growth are calculated and that scion size be standardized as much as possible at the start of the experiment. Once proper metrics are chosen, all of the available published evidence is largely concordant with two concepts: (1) age-mediated controls of tree growth are likely to be important during the first few years of a tree's life (before phase change); and (2) after the first few years of a tree's life, size-mediated factors largely prevail over age-mediated factors in determining tree growth rates. We found no support for theories invoking age-mediated sink limitations in old trees.},

abstract = {Trees need to store reserves to allow their survival during winter and for bud flush and leaf growth in the following spring. In many tree species, these reserve functions are mainly covered by starch, which is degraded to soluble carbohydrates during the dormant season for maintenance respiration and in spring during bud flush. We conducted girdling experiments on poplar (Populus deltoides x nigra cv. Dorskamp) in order to elucidate how interrupted transport of carbohydrates to the roots during autumn affects plant survival during winter and bud flush in spring. We measured the content of starch, sucrose, glucose, fructose, raffinose and stachyose in stems (above and below the girdle), coarse roots and fine roots over 1 year. We found that, in response to girdling, carbohydrates accumulated in stems above the girdle. As a result of interrupted reserve allocation, girdled plants depleted their root starch reserves nearly to zero, whereas in stems below the girdle, reserves were maintained close to control values, presumably in order to facilitate dormancy release and re-sprouting from buds below the girdle. Furthermore, we showed that stachyose accumulated during winter also in the roots, even in girdled plants, consistent with its importance as freezing protectant.

@article{Reich1983,
abstract = {Chronic exposure of hybrid poplar (Populus deltoides x trichocarpa) plants to low concentrations of ozone had negative impact upon net photosynthetic capacity, dark respiration, and leaf chlorophyll contents. Exposure to as much as 0.20 microliters per liter O(3) had no immediate effect on net photosynthesis (P(n)), but chronic exposure to 0.125 or 0.085 microliters per liter had a number of gradual effects on CO(2) exchange. These included increased dark respiration and consequently increased light compensation points in very young leaves (4-6 days old); and decreased P(n), leaf chlorophyll a and b contents, light saturation points, and apparent quantum yields in leaves 10 to 70 days old. Decreased P(n) was partially due to accelerated aging in leaves exposed to O(3), and lightsaturated P(n) was linearly related to chlorophyll a + b contents. Differences in light-saturated P(n) between control and O(3)-treated leaves of the same age were mostly due to photosaturation in O(3)-treated leaves and to a much lesser extent to lowered apparent quantum yields. Also, since P(n) and dark respiration were most affected by O(3) at different leaf ages, distinct modes of action are suggested. The effects of leaf aging on CO(2) exchange were considerable, but typical of other species. However, careful monitoring of the interacting effects of leaf age and pollutant exposure was needed in order to characterize the impact of chronic O(3) exposure upon CO(2) exchange.},

@article{Tyree1988,
abstract = {We discuss the relationship between the dynamically changing tension gradients required to move water rapidly through the xylem conduits of plants and the proportion of conduits lost through embolism as a result of water tension. We consider the implications of this relationship to the water relations of trees. We have compiled quantitative data on the water relations, hydraulic architecture and vulnerability of embolism of four widely different species: Rhizophora mangle, Cassipourea elliptica, Acer saccharum, and Thuja occidentalis. Using these data, we modeled the dynamics of water flow and xylem blockage for these species. The model is specifically focused on the conditions required to generate ;runaway embolism,' whereby the blockage of xylem conduits through embolism leads to reduced hydraulic conductance causing increased tension in the remaining vessels and generating more tension in a vicious circle. The model predicted that all species operate near the point of catastrophic xylem failure due to dynamic water stress. The model supports Zimmermann's plant segmentation hypothesis. Zimmermann suggested that plants are designed hydraulically to sacrifice highly vulnerable minor branches and thus improve the water balance of remaining parts. The model results are discussed in terms of the morphology, hydraulic architecture, eco-physiology, and evolution of woody plants.},
